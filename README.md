 What is Test Harness?
 
 Test harness is an automated test framework which we use to test a program unit. It is made of stubs and drivers that help in interacting
 with the software and make testing easier.

The following two main parts comprise it:

Test Execution Engine
Test Script Repository

Test harness executes tests, by using a test library and generates a log report. It requires that your test scripts are designed to handle
different test scenarios and test data.
